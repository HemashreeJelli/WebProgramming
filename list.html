    <dt>How to Train Your Dragon</dt>
    <dd>
      This heartwarming animated film is about a young Viking named Hiccup who befriends a dragon, Toothless. 
      It’s an adventure full of growth, friendship, and emotional depth. The story is engaging, and the animation is stunning, making it a timeless classic for all ages.

    <dt>Interstellar</dt>
    <dd>
      Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar explores the theme of survival and love across the universe. With breathtaking visuals and a gripping plot, 
      the movie delves into space exploration, black holes, and the human connection, while also addressing the existential question of what makes us human. 
      It’s thought-provoking and emotionally charged.

    <dt>Black Swan</dt>
    <dd>
      Black Swan is a psychological thriller that follows Nina Sayers, a talented ballerina struggling with the pressure of perfection and her obsession with playing the
      lead role in Swan Lake. The film takes you on a dark journey of mental unraveling, with incredible performances, particularly from Natalie Portman, making it an
      intense and compelling watch.
